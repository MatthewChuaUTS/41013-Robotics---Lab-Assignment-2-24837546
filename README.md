# Welcome to our project!

## To do list 
 **Remember to maintain regular code commits and adhere to coding standards throughout the project.**
- [x] Form a group of 2-3 students
- [x] Choose a pick-and-place application outside of traditional factory settings
- [x] Select one existing robot arm from the Robotics Toolbox
- [x] Setup Github
- [x] Teach Github
- [ ] Model a new 6DOF (or higher) industrial robot arm not in the Toolbox
	- [ ] Exactly like the LinearUR3, except following the DH parameters of our chosen robot
- [ ] Create a simulated environment for your chosen scenario
- [ ] Implement a MATLAB/Python graphical user interface (GUI) with:
   - [ ] Advanced "teach" functionality
   - [ ] Individual joint movements
   - [ ] Cartesian movements
- [ ] Incorporate a functional e-stop (simulated and real)
- [ ] Add safety features to the simulated environment:
   - [ ] Barriers
   - [ ] Warning signs/lights/sirens
- [ ] Implement collision detection and avoidance
- [ ] Set up a code repository (preferably GitHub) for the project
- [ ] Complete and submit the Week 7 Proposal:
    - [ ] Discuss with lead tutors
    - [ ] Submit details via Google Form
- [ ] Update and improve individual SWMS and Risk Assessment from Assignment 1
- [ ] Create a 1-minute promotional video for Week 11 submission
- [ ] Develop the final system demonstration:
    - [ ] Integrate two robot arms
    - [ ] Implement path planning
    - [ ] Add collision avoidance
    - [ ] Incorporate real robot functionality
- [ ] Create the 3-minute final video showcasing the project
- [ ] Prepare for the final individual code viva
- [ ] Optional: Incorporate additional hardware or RGB-D sensor data for bonus marks
- [ ] Complete final group member peer feedback via Spark+
